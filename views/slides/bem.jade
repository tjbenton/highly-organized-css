      - Avoids Nesting (single-level specificity)
      - Clear picture of what CSS & HTML are doing
      - No Guessing
      - Clearly deliniates components
      - Scales marvelously

    ### Two Schools of Thought on approaching nested classes

    ### Both agree not to do this
    This is terribly verbose and also forces a DOM structure upon us; it is very inflexible
    
    ```scss
    .list
      .list__header
      .list__items
        .list__items__item
          .list__items__item__title
          .list__items__item__content
          .list__items__item__actions
      .list__footer
    ```

    ### 1. Flattening everything to be on the same level
    ```scss
    .list
      .list__header
      .list__items
        .list__item
          .list__title
          .list__content
          .list__actions
      .list__footer
    ```

    ### 2. Separate those elements
    ```scss
    .list
      .list__header
      .list__items
          .list-item
            .list-item__header
            .list-item__body
      .list__footer
    ```

    A way to avoid this problem is to not Block your scope too high up.

    ```scss
    .room
      .room__floor
      .room__desk
        .room__laptop
    ```
    vs
    
    ```scss
    .room
      .room__floor

    .desk

    .laptop
    ```
