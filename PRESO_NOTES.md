CSS Specificity slide - break in to fragments

`This is terribly verbose and also forces a DOM structure upon us; it is very inflexible` - just say this, dont have it in the slide

the namespacing slide has 2 sentences that are essentially the same. remove one of them

remove the page section, if you haven't already

slide with examples for scoped (s-header), you're not using bem, not sure if you wanna change that or not

**if your preso is long** consider removing the js-part, since it's technically not css related. if time is good, keep it

hahahaha ie hack names!

on the read like a story slide, you could get some audience participation here by asking about what they see in this code.
